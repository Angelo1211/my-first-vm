# I've never written a virtual machine, let's fix that.

## 2022/01/28

Finished the VM! It works, I've tested it with the 2048 and rogue games from the article and it all seems to execute correctly. It's cool but I feel like I won't appreciate how cool it is to write something like this until I get the chance to write some of the ASM for the VM, so I think I'll be doing that next time.

Well that was awesome! I didn't get to do the whole thing but I did get about halfway through, so not that close to writing the entire thing in one flight, but not too bad either. I was held back by missing the spec for the LC3. I'll try to finish the rest of it later today. I'll upload the notes I took later too, although they're not too different from Justin's article, which was excellent!

I've got a 7 hour flight early tomorrow morning, I'd like to step into the flight with no idea of how VMs work and walk out of it with a working one.

## Resources I've downloaded ahead of time:

* [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton
* [lc3tools](https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048) by Ryan Pendleton
* [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom

It should be fun!

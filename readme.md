# I've never written a virtual machine, let's fix that.

I've got a 7 hour flight early tomorrow morning, I'd like to step into the flight with no idea of how VMs work and walk out of it with a working one.

## Resources I've downloaded ahead of time:

* [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton
* [lc3tools](https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048) by Ryan Pendleton
* [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom

It should be fun!

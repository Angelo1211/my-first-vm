# I've never written a virtual machine, let's fix that.

I've been reading about writing ASM for the VM, and its interesting. I'm finding this more challenging than writing the entire VM, probably because I don't have too much experience with ASM and also because I'm very comfortable in the land of C, but not so much in the land of ASM. I've acquired the textbook from which the lc3 spec was obtained in the article and I think I'll read the chapter about assembly in there tomorrow and write some notes about that.

Finished the VM! It works, I've tested it with the 2048 and rogue games from the article and it all seems to execute correctly. It's cool but I feel like I won't appreciate how cool it is to write something like this until I get the chance to write some of the ASM for the VM, so I think I'll be doing that next time.

Well that was awesome! I didn't get to do the whole thing but I did get about halfway through, so not that close to writing the entire thing in one flight, but not too bad either. I was held back by missing the spec for the LC3. I'll try to finish the rest of it later today. I'll upload the notes I took later too, although they're not too different from Justin's article, which was excellent!

I've got a 7 hour flight early tomorrow morning, I'd like to step into the flight with no idea of how VMs work and walk out of it with a working one.

It should be fun!
